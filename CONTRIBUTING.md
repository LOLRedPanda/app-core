## How Can I Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª üíª, and find related reports üîé.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

<!-- TODO : Fill out [the required template](), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster. -->

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

<!-- * **Check the [debugging guide]().** -->

* **Check the [faq]() and the [discussions]()** for a list of common questions and problems.

<!--TODO: add our own cursory search -->
* **Perform a [cursory search]()** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.




<!-- * [Discord Server]() TODO -->
* [FAQ](https://flight-manual.atom.io/faq/)

Short Links to Important Resources:
   docs: handbook / roadmap (you'll learn more about this in the roadmapping session)
   bugs: issue tracker / bug report tool
   comms: forum link, developer list, IRC/email
Testing: how to test the project, where the tests are located in your directories.
Environment details: how to set up your development environment. This might exist in the README.md depending on the project. If so, include a link.
How to submit changes: Pull Request protocol etc. You might also include what response they'll get back from the team on submission, or any caveats about the speed of response.
How to report a bug: Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
Templates: in this section of your file, you might also want to link to a bug report "template" like this one here which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs tidy and relevant.
First bugs for Contributors: Sometimes it is helpful to provide some guidelines for the types of bugs contributors should tackle (should they want to fix the bugs and not just submit them), see Atom's example section here.
How to request an "enhancement" - enhancements are features that you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with the existing code; there is a "label" for enhancments in Github's Issues (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues as "enhancement," and thereby allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs reported to the project. See Atom's example section.
Style Guide / Coding conventions - See Atom's example.
Code of Conduct - You can make this part of CONTRIBUTING.md as Atom did to set the tone for contributions. You can also make this a separate Markdown file and link to it in CONTRIBUTING.md. You can also extend this section to link to your LICENSE.md or any details for project consumers on permissions and license details you have established for building on your work.
Recognition model - provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for contributing and list any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project.
Who is involved? - Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a humans.txt file in your root directory (same place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here is an example of a humans.txt file.
Where can I ask for help? - a nice extension to the previous section, with links to good comms channels for anyone with questions.
Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file
Start by making the structure of your project clean and welcoming, with folder titles that make sense, if you have several projects, consider adopting a template "project structure" that is consistent across projects, take a look at this example.

Author a CONTRIBUTING.md file that fits your projects. Check out the models below in "Followup Resources" and incorporate the appropriate "To Include" items above.

Make Supporting Materials
Make a LICENSE: Make a LICENSE.md file that you can reference in your CONTRIBUTING.md file, use the following links to generate and copy the appropriate text: https://creativecommons.org/choose/
http://choosealicense.com/

Make a README - make a README.md with a brief description of your project and some setup/installation details that you might link to in your CONTRIBUTING.md file.

Create a system for rewarding people
(OPTIONAL) Include a humans.txt file to give accolades to contributors. Store this in your root directory just like your CONTRIBUTING.md. On deployment, it will be available via your website at www.YOURWEBSITE.com/humans.txt.

(OPTIONAL) Get a DOI for a your project and make Contributor Badges as a way to recognize contributors for their particular contributions.

Hat-tip or thank people in your README.md, especially if you forked their repo. Thank people when they submit issues or requests; be polite.
